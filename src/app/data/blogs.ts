<p>Here’s how to select the best colors for your home:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Start with a Base:</strong> Choose one main color (neutral or bold) that anchors the space.</li>
  <li><strong>Use the 60-30-10 Rule:</strong> 60% base color, 30% secondary, 10% accent.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider Light Exposure:</strong> Rooms with low light work best with warm tones, while bright rooms handle cooler tones better.</li>
  <li><strong>Incorporate Nature:</strong> Earthy tones like olive, clay, and sand offer timeless appeal.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t Forget Psychology:</strong> Blues for calm, yellows for energy, and greens for balance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test swatches on your walls before committing—color changes dramatically with lighting and surrounding furniture.</p>`,
